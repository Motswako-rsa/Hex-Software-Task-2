The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher .The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

I simply used the Iris Dataset to:
Explore its structure.
Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
Visualize the data using plots and graphs to understand the distribution of each feature
